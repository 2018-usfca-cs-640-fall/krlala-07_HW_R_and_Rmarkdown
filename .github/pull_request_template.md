#### Specific tasks completed

- [ ] I have read about how to write an [appropriate commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) and followed these practices for my commit messages on this repo.
- [ ] I have revised the code in the Rmd file to produce at least 4 figures and/or tables that collectively describe a focused analysis of the sequence data from this study.
- [ ] I have added the necessary text to the other sections of the Rmd file (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion).
- [ ] My Rmd file knits successfully and passes all `lintr` checks (if it does not, Travis will let you know).
